I'm a creative, motivated front-end web developer and I love what I do. I'm *passionate about new technology*, <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> web standards (<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>3, JavaScript) and shaping the future of the web.

When I'm not busy creating things for the interweb, I'm usually thinking about [music](http://www.last.fm/user/jameslutley), guitars, travel, [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jameslutley) and snowboarding. I've lived and studied in Australia for a year, I did an *amazing snowboarding season in New Zealand* and I've travelled around much of Southeast Asia. I also used to be a lawyer in a previous life and I designed a professional music recording studio *(you could say I like technical challenges)*.
